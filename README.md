# Reference FNB Recon Backend

This repository contains code that implements Azure Functions to provide an API for Robots that require integration with Azure services. It offers a secure pathway to all the Cloud services necessary and provides a single place for Robots to use API's to satisfy their requirements.

The choice of Azure Functions as serverless backend provides a cost benefit in that the backend application is not running up any charges when it is not running.
